<h1>A Broker Example: Three Syntaxes - One Semantics</h1>
 
<p>
Relfun is exemplified here by a simple broker program that
decides which products to buy for customers.
Relfun's classical Prolog-like and Lisp-like syntaxes are
augmented by the recent XML-based <a href="http://www.relfun.org/rfml/">RFML</a> syntax.
It is important to notice that all three syntaxes stand for
one semantics (enabling, e.g., a Lisp-XML-Prolog-Lisp round trip):
