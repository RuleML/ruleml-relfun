<h1>
<a NAME="about"></a>About Apache</h1>
The 
<a href="http://www.apache.org">Apache Project</a>
 is a collaborative software development effort aimed
at creating a robust, commercial-grade, featureful, and freely-available
source code implementation of an HTTP (Web) server. The project is jointly
managed by a group of volunteers located around the world, using the Internet
and the Web to communicate, plan, and develop the server and its related
documentation. These volunteers are known as the Apache Group. In addition,
hundreds of users have contributed ideas, code, and documentation to the
project.
<p>Apache is <b>the most popular web server in the world</b>, with around
60% market share, more than twice than Microsoft IIS!
<p>According to <a href="http://www.netcraft.com/survey">Netcraft</a>,
"May 1999 sees Apache go past the 3 million sites mark. The widespread
deployment of Apache amongst hosting companies and ISPs ensures that Apache
is in a better position to echo the growth of the web than any other server,
and this has been a longterm theme of the Web Server survey. "
